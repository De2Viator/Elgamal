This code implements the ElGamal algorithm for better performance using small numbers for encrypting and signing the message.

I compile this code using CLion, which uses the gcc compiler under the hood.
Additionally, I use OpenSSL and Boost.
Before using Boost, I installed it on my PC via Chocolatey. You can find it on their official site: https://www.boost.org/users/download/
The same story with OpenSSL: https://www.openssl.org/source/
